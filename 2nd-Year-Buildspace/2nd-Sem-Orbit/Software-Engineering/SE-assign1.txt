1. Consider the program in folder assign1
a> Compile it so that it compiles with debugging
symbols [using proper option]
-> gcc -g a.c -o a
b> Put breakpoint to function f1.
-> b f1
c> Put breakpoint to line 10 of b.c
-> b b.c:10
d> Run the program until it finishes. Which
commands are you using to take it to completion?
-> r (for run the program)
   c (using multiple times for completation of the program)
e> How many times breakpoint “1” is hit in one run of
the program ?
-> 6 (value=3)
f> How many times breakpoint “2” is hit in one run of
the program
-> 3 (value=3)
g> How you can see details about a breakpoint ?
-> info b 1
h> How you can see details about all breakpoints ?
-> info b
i> What is value of variable x in f1 when breakpoint
“1” is hit for 3 rd time ? How you can examine it ?
-> 33
   run(r) and continue(c) until breakpoint "1" hits for 3rd time then for the value of x enter "p x"
j> Rerun the program.put a breakpoint at function
f0. list 5 lines where it has stopped with
breakpoint 3 for firsttime.
-> b f0
   set listsize 5
   r
